# Transition Panel Plugin
This JavaScript plugin is used to help transition different panel contents to a 
main view by either through a button (nav) click or through JavaScript code.

You can find a basic guide on my website at [http://brandonsherette.com/blog/transition-panel-plugin/](http://brandonsherette.com/blog/transition-panel-plugin/), or 
by going through the example folder for a working demonstration of the plugin in action.
